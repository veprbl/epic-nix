      PODIO, or plain-old-data I/O, is a C++ library to support the creation
      and handling of data models in particle physics. It is based on the idea
      of employing plain-old-data (POD) data structures wherever possible,
      while avoiding deep-object hierarchies and virtual inheritance. This is
      to both improve runtime performance and simplify the implementation of
      persistency services.
